what processes I currently have running
ps will only show processes running in the current terminal for current user
ps u will show all processes for the user on the current machine OR
ps -u dp1092 will show all processes for the user dp1092

what are all of the processes running on the system
ps -e
or
ps -ef to get more information about the processes
